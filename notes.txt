Feedback from Demo on Feb 20
============================
-People expect swipe interface
-game is too nice (not loss screen)
-loss and win transition
-needs score
-talk existing companies to see if we could addapt their libreries of games to fit out system
-A way to better connect the minigames with the questions
-A minigame that also incorporates answering questions to progress
  // (this symbol means notetaker thought)
  // This is a good idea -- I wonder if we can have intermediate things
  // One type which is a minigame, one type which is a question, and
  // another type for a "minigame question!"
  // Potentially, we could do it in special instances if they miss
  // a question?
- We need better instructions for people not used to playing games
- It might be interesting to have a story so people know where the games are headed
- More variance in the same minigame
- Make there be a reward for answering a question correctly
- Maybe not a constant system like  MMQMMQ but make it so that if
	they miss questions they will get more etc.
- Somehow get information about how much fun kids are having with the games
- Feedback from the game based on what is going on -- difficult if they are not comfortable with english
- Questions - do you want them to win the first time they play it?
- The same minigame is different every time? Randomized slightly to keep the kids interested?
- What increased controls can we add to these current games?
  // Possibly "goals" in our minigames that you aren't punished for but get
  // extra points if you do correctly. E.g. "jump through the loop!" in desert jump.
- Allow intuitive reaction to occur. Show the user how to play the game better than
	we are doing now.
- Not boring, but not no longer a minigame.
 // We need to really start thinking about and designing all aspects of our minigames
 // Currently, our designs are "cool" but not really encapsulating.
- Kids are scared by afnan
- The ceiling is better than our game...
 // However, the ceiling in Newell-Simon is actually quite interesting.
- Putting a finger so people know where to touch
- More game modes
- Have something associated with the minigames, don't understand what the minigames are supposed to be teaching.
- Fluid transitions
- More green -Salem
 // Nice notes Sebrand...
- "What were you doing in car racing?" Confusing controls/visuals
- Goals not clear -- some way to show what to do in all of our games.
 // Possibly something where they see a "ghost" of what they are supposed to do
 // if it can't be immediately obvious. Also, could use short, basic english?
- Too slow
- Pay more attention to when our questions show up.
 // That's Important enough that Bernadine asked about it in the demo
 // She clearly is focusing more on the applications side, which we are neglecting a little
- Controls confusing, especially when the same looking red button has multiple controls.
- Make it more clear which car you are in the racing game. (You're the green car!!)
- Need to implement overall score.
- Need feedback for win/loss.
- If you flip the car before the jump it's a deadlock. 
- How to make the games quick but somewhat more challenging/ engaging.
- Knocking over the initial screen is not obvious what to do.
- Highlight "who you are" in each game.
 // I think that this is the time where we need to start focusing on design
 // and begin making everything we do "finalized" or at least polished.
- Coco subsersive human
- Matt heartless bastard
- Our game is GREAT
- Afnan records all of his phone conversations, so be careful.
- Love the transitions
- Apparently the one game where you hold the button is able to be beaten by tapping.
- Strangely pretty fun, he seems to be captivated... even though he knows there's only two he keeps going!
- Timer
- Questions that relate to minigames
- shouldn't be able to win the game without thinking (just going full throttle),
  instead make each game require some skill (like judging the correct throttle level)
- Kosbie says, "Good job guys!" (February 20, 2014, 6:26 PM)
